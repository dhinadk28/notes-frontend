This project involves building a notes application with authentication functionality, allowing users to register and log in using their email and password. Once logged in, users can create, update, and delete notes.

The application provides a user-friendly interface for users to add and edit their notes. They can enter the title and content of each note, and the application will save and display them accordingly. Users can also update or delete existing notes as needed.

To enhance the user experience, the application includes toast notifications for actions such as adding, updating, or deleting notes. These notifications provide visual feedback to the user, ensuring they are aware of the status of their actions.

Furthermore, users have the option to switch between dark mode and light mode, which can be toggled through a UI element. The application saves the user's preference using local storage, ensuring that the selected mode persists across sessions.

The application's user interface is designed to be responsive, allowing users to access and interact with their notes seamlessly across various screen sizes. The responsive design ensures that the application adapts and provides an optimal viewing and interaction experience on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

In summary, this project involves creating a notes application with authentication, note creation and management functionality, toast notifications, dark mode toggle, and a responsive user interface.
