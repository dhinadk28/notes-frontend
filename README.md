The "Notes App using MERN stack" is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. This app has been developed using the MERN stack, which is a combination of four powerful technologies: MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

One of the essential features of this Notes App is that it uses password hashing techniques to ensure that users' login credentials are secure. Additionally, the app uses token login to provide a more secure authentication process. This makes the app more secure and ensures that users' information is protected from hackers and other malicious activities.

The app has a beautiful user interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the application.
